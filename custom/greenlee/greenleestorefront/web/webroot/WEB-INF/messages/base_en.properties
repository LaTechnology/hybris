productDetailPage.masterController.message=The AirScout master controller (ASM300) is a dual-band MIMO wireless access point which when combined with three2 or more remote client units will evaluate the likely performance of the entire installation. The ASM300 should be placed approximately where the client gateway device will eventually be installed. However, note that one aspect of the AirScout system is that recommendations may later be made to re-locate this for optimum coverage throughout the premises.
productDetailPage.clients=Clients
productDetailPage.clients.message=The remote AirScout client (ASC300) devices are also dual band MIMO and are also placed in approximately the same places real end-user devices would be used around the home.
productDetailPage.software=Software
productDetailPage.software.message1=AirScout is operated by an App running on a commonly available tablet computer3 . Once the App is started and communication is established to the AirScout master controller. An outline floor plan of the site is developed in the “App”. Most commonly by dragging a standard shape “house plan” onto the working screen and the "access point" placed on this in its relative position. Absolute scale is not important. Each of the ASC300 clients is then placed onto the floor-plan in roughly the proportional positions they are in the real-world; at this point the technician can re-assign names to the client devices if necessary making test reports easier to understand for the client.
productDetailPage.software.message2=The technician then simply presses the “start test” button in the app and is free to get on with more conventional installation tasks while AirScout continues testing autonomously. Typically with six client devices the whole test sequence takes approximately five minutes; compare that to having to stand still with a single hand-held device in each location for several minutes to carry out a manual survey.
